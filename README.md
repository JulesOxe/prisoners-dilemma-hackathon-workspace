# Prisoner's Dilemma Hackathon - Workspace
## Expose
A small hackathon project in which a group of friends can develop several small algorithms that then compete against each other in the context of the Prisoner's dilemma. This is the workspace through which the various algorithms created can be collected. The main project can be found at: [Main Repository](https://github.com/JulesOxe/prisoners-dilemma-hackathon)
## Preperations
For each participant, create a copy of the package `PrisonerX` under _src/main/java_ and rename it and the class in it to the correct letter of the participant.  
Do the same for the `TestPrisonerX` class under _src/test/java_. Make sure that an object of the correct class is created in the `setUp()` function.
